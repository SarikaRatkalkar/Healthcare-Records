This project simulates a healthcare database system using MySQL. It includes tables for patients, doctors, encounters, prescriptions, tests, procedures, and medical history. The database supports various types of queries including DDL (Data Definition Language), DML (Data Manipulation Language), subqueries, and joins for real-world healthcare use cases such as:
Tracking patient visits and diagnoses
Recording prescriptions and instructions
Logging diagnostic tests and results
Documenting surgical procedures
Generating analytical reports using GROUP BY, subqueries, and joins
